# war-cards
A game of WAR! with cards 

# Rules
This is a game played by two or more players.
In this game, the deck of 52 cards is distributed evenly to the players.
The players draw a card, and the one with a higher card takes the other's cards and keeps his (or her :)) card, too.
The last player with any remaining card(s) is the winner.

# Note
If there's a tie in cards, the players go to WAR.
In a WAR, players pick three cards; if they cannot, they've lost the WAR.
The last out of the three cards is turned out, and the one with the highest card wins the WAR, and the game proceeds to the next round.
